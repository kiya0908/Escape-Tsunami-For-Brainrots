    "description1": "Escape Tsunami For Brainrots (also known as ETFB) is a high-stakes survival and collection game on Roblox. This thrilling experience blends the excitement of outrunning massive elemental waves with the chaotic fun of collecting \"brainrot\" meme characters. ETFB isn't just a running simulator—it's a base-building tycoon wrapped in a disaster survival package.",
    "description2": "The core gameplay loop is addictive: you enter dangerous zones to scavenge for Brainrots while dodging periodic, deadly tsunamis. Successfully bringing these items back to your base generates passive income. You use that money to upgrade your speed, jump height, and bag capacity, allowing you to venture into deeper, more dangerous zones for rarer loot.",

        "answer": "We recommend waiting until you have unlocked at least the Sandy Zone in Escape Tsunami For Brainrots and have a steady income of around $500/s. Doing your first ETFB rebirth too early makes the grind back to basic speed painful."
